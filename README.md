## Getting Started

I started exploring Prismic, and at first, everything went well. However, as usual, deploying on Vercel was tricky, and I couldnâ€™t get it to deploy. Since GitHub Pages does not natively support hosting Next.js apps, here is a screenshot. I will still keep trying to figure out a solution, though!
